    <h1>Images</h1>
    <h2>What can Html do with Images?</h2>
    <p>Let's find out!</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Standalone Images</h2>
    <p>These images are simply for show. They do nothing on the site, and are better used when you want to show something with text. I will provide some examples below.</p>

    <h3>Standalone image with no restrictions. (scroll down)</h3>
    <img src="./Images/jackson-sophat-wUbNvDTsOIc-unsplash.jpg" alt="giant image of HTML"/>
    <p>Pretty big image huh? This is what happens when you don't put any restrictions. Here is a<br>
        sample of the code that allows this to exist. -> "img src="./Images/jackson-sophat-wUbNvDTsOIc-unsplash.jpg" alt="giant image of HTML"" 
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Image with Restrictions</h3>
    <img src="./Images/jackson-sophat-wUbNvDTsOIc-unsplash.jpg" height="300px" alt="Medium image of HTML"/>
    <p>Now here is a pretty normal image of what is above. More comfortable to look around huh? well this is actually the same code, but with the attribute "height" placed in it.
        <br>now that we are here, let me try to explain what the code up above says. Element img, is to implement the image itself. src just looks for where the image might be.
        <br>
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Image with a (link)</h3>
    <p>Here I will provide two different kind of embeded images. I will provide one image that will send you to another part of this site, <br>
        and one where it will send you to another website. I will be using the anchor element with the img element in between the tags
    </p>
    <a href="./Dead ends/Dead image site.html"><img src="./Images/jackson-sophat-wUbNvDTsOIc-unsplash.jpg" height="300px"/></a>
    <h4>Check where this one takes you. ^</h4>
