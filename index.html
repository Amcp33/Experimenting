    <h1>Experiment #1</h1>
    <h2>An assesment on the Lessons Taken for Web Development.</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>In this Project, I am going to try to experiment everything I have learned about HTML + CSS.<br> I have learned alot in the previous days but finally feel like I've reached a stump. <br> I am going to start with what I have learned with HTML, hence the page you are on now.
      It has already started in case you didn't realize. <br> This paragraph isn't a  "p" by "p" element. There are "br" elements in between that split the text like this.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>As you can see, above this text is a line, that split this text with the other one. (I'm also using another "p"). That line is called and "hr".</p>
    <p>This is another "p". You can tell by the gap of the top "p".</p>
    <p>Let me also explain the very top, there is an "h1" for "experiment #1" and an "h2" for the text after it. <br>
       remember that there can only be one "h1" in a html file.
    </p>
    <p> Below, I will provide you links to other files that will show you what else this power can do.<br>
         Only HTML specific for now, then a CSS file will be created once I think it's ready
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Click on any of the links below.</h2>
    <p>These links will actually be what we know as "a"  and "href". "a" is an anchor/word or image, which will send you where the href sends you which in this case will be the link. Think of it like a hook.</p>
    <p>This list order I'm about to do is also another element know as "ul" or "ol". They are followed up by "li"</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="./images.html">Images</a></li>
        <li><a href="./UL,OL.html">OL/UL</a></li>
        <li><a href="./Sample.html">CSS</a></li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <footer>This is a footer. Doesn't look different from a P, but once you add some Css. Oof. So much better. For now, this is what it looks like you geek.</footer>
