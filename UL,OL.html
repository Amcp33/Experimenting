    <h1>Introduction to OL/UL</h1>
    <p>This is actually very simple to understand. The OL/UL elements make a sort of list on the site. Ol stands for Ordered line. Which will bring the numbers down from the numer 1 and onwards.<br>
    The other one is Unordered line. This one allows you to to list stuff without numbers, and simply dots. Here are the following examples.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <p>Ordered Line</p>
        <li>Sample</li>
        <li>Sample2</li>
        <li>Sample 3</li>
        <li>You're gay</li>
    </ol>

    <ul>
        <p>Unordered Line</p>
        <li>Sample</li>
        <li>Sample 2</li>
        <li>Sample 3</li>
        <li>Sample 4</li>
        <li>You're Gay</li>
    </ul>

    <p>That's it. That's the lesson. What more did you expect? Loser.</p>

    <p>Well, there is actually one more thing, but I forgot how to do it. The ordered line could have the opposite numbers going from down to up. Oh, and you can stack lists. but it becomes a bit complex sometimes if you're not organized enough.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Here's an example</li>
        <ul>
            <li>it</li>
            <li>is</li>
            <li>me</li>
        </ul>
        <li>lol</li>
    </ol>
